# Client/Server Chat Program
This project serves as a Hello World project for the C++ networking library, with a database connection for validation and a client/server connection. It was made in less than a week for my Networking class while I was studying at Fanshawe College in Canada.

In reality, this project combines two projects within the same week. The first project had to be finished in three days, after which we had to expand upon this project for the latter three days.

## First project
The first project involved creating a chat program with a server and a client. Once the server program was running, clients could connect and join a chat room with other clients. The clients had the ability to switch rooms and the main focus was on establishing and managing connections, making requests to the server, and running these requests asynchronously. The server was designed to receive requests, process data, and respond accordingly. 

After the first project, I had a simple chat program up and running. This program would handle the requests asynchronously and allow the client to join a room and chat with others.

## Second project
In the second project, we had to continue working on the first project and add a validation server that would allow the chat server to forward user-related requests and ask for validation. This would allow the client to register and/or log in using an email and a password. The validation server must store and access the data in a database at runtime. 

After implementing the second project, we have a project that allows the user to register and log in, join chatrooms, and chat with other clients.
